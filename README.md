# Interactive Resume with HTML5

> [My Resume](resume.jndesigns.io) (no recruiters please)

This project is:
* Inspired by R. Leonardi's infamous (jQuery based)  [Interactive Resume](rleonardi.com/interactive-resume/).
* Built using the fantastic [Phaser](phaser.io) gaming framework
* Designed using the Google's Material design specification
* Used to pass the first zipline at [Free Code Camp](freecodecamp.com)
* Modular and reusable, so feel free to fork it  :thumbsup:
